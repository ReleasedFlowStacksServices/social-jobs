The FlowStacks Social Jobs Repository for Handling Application or System Jobs for use with the Social Networking sites
------
Version:    1.0

Compatible: FlowStacks Beta Release

Repository Information
------
This FlowStacks Repository is for hosting Jobs (found in src) focused on social networks and wrapped under a FlowStacks REST API Endpoint on deployment. Using the FlowStacks REST API invokes Jobs to accomplish work on our platform for your applications or systems which could be as simple as creating, retrieving, updating, deleting databases records or advanced general purpose processing. This Repository will be maintained as a starting point for all new users to the FlowStacks platform to build derived value from creating Jobs that can be shared between GitHub users having similar use cases and needs. This includes building a shared database schema that is used by the Jobs as a data solution for these common, shared Jobs. 

Consider building a social networking site, the application stack will need a REST API tied to scalable backend to handle the traffic load. The REST API is the right tool for publishing Jobs to handle the use cases around running a social network. Our Jobs are directly tied to your free user databases as well as they can access third party services and legacy systems or databases outside of FlowStacks. Use our FlowStacks Endpoints to power and easily integrate your applications or systems to the major social networks.
